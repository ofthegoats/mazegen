#+title: mazegen

Mazegen is a simple C maze generation program.

It can be compiled with ~clang~ or ~gcc~ and the provided Makefile uses ~clang~.

When run, it will await an input in the format ~WIDTH HEIGHT~. It will then
print a randomly generated maze to stdout.

This may be useful as a tool for teaching algorithms and data structures on
graphs or C.
